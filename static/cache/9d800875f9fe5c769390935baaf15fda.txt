Of course. Let's start by finding a comfortable seated position, either on the floor or in a chair. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, and exhale out through your mouth. 

Begin to bring your awareness to the present moment, letting go of any thoughts or distractions. Allow yourself to fully arrive in this space, letting go of any tension or stress you may be holding onto.

Now, take a moment to acknowledge and validate any feelings of frustration or doubt you may be experiencing. Without judgment, simply observe these feelings and allow them to be present without trying to push them away.

As you continue to breathe deeply, imagine a warm, golden light surrounding you. Feel this light enveloping you in a sense of comfort and security, reminding you of your inherent worth and value.

With each breath, allow this light to fill you up from within, radiating outwards and illuminating the truth of your worthiness. Know that you are deserving of love, respect, and acceptance just as you are in this moment.

Take a few more deep breaths, feeling the warmth and reassurance of this light surrounding you. Let it remind you that your value is not determined by external factors, but by the essence of who you are at your core.

As we come to the end of this meditation, take a moment to express gratitude to yourself for taking this time to honor your worth and value. When you are ready, gently open your eyes and carry this sense of self-worth and acceptance with you as you continue with your day.

Remember that you are enough, just as you are. Thank you for practicing this meditation with me today.
