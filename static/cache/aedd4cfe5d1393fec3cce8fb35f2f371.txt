Find a quiet and comfortable place where you can sit or lie down. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in, filling your lungs with fresh air, and then exhale slowly, releasing any tension or stress.

Now, bring your awareness to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. With each inhale, imagine you are breathing in calmness and clarity. And with each exhale, imagine you are releasing any doubts or uncertainties.

As you continue to breathe deeply and mindfully, bring your attention to the center of your chest. Visualize a warm and vibrant light glowing in this area. This light represents your true value and worth.

With each breath, allow this light to expand and fill your entire being, illuminating every cell with a sense of purpose and self-worth. Feel the warmth and radiance of this light spreading throughout your body, reminding you of your inherent value and uniqueness.

Now, repeat the following affirmations silently or out loud:

"I am worthy of love and acceptance."
"I am deserving of all good things in life."
"I recognize my own value and honor it."

Feel these words resonating within you, anchoring you in a deep sense of self-worth and confidence.

Take a few more deep breaths, feeling the light within you shining brighter with each inhale. Allow yourself to bask in this feeling of inner worth and value.

When you are ready, gently bring your awareness back to the present moment. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and slowly open your eyes.

Remember that your true value comes from within and cannot be defined by external circumstances or opinions. Trust in your worth and let it guide you on your path towards fulfillment and happiness.

Take this feeling of self-worth with you as you go about your day, knowing that you are valuable just as you are.
