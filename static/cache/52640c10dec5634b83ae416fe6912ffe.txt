Of course! Let's begin.

Find a comfortable and quiet space where you can sit or lie down. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths in and out, allowing your body to relax with each exhale.

Now, bring your awareness to the feeling of upset that you are experiencing. Acknowledge it without judgment, allowing yourself to fully feel and accept your emotions in this moment.

As you continue to breathe deeply, imagine a warm and soothing light surrounding you, enveloping you in a sense of comfort and peace. Feel this light radiating through your body, easing any tension or discomfort you may be holding onto.

With each breath, visualize releasing the negative emotions and thoughts that are weighing you down. Let them go with each exhale, allowing yourself to feel lighter and more at ease with each passing moment.

Now, bring your focus to your heart center. Imagine a gentle wave of compassion and love washing over you, offering you solace and understanding. Allow yourself to be held in this loving embrace, knowing that it is okay to feel upset and that you are not alone in your emotions.

Take a few more deep breaths here, feeling the love and compassion filling your heart and soul. Know that it is okay to feel what you are feeling and that it is a natural part of being human.

When you are ready, slowly begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and gently open your eyes.

Remember that it is important to honor and acknowledge your emotions, and that it is okay to seek support and comfort when you are feeling upset. You are not alone, and you are deserving of love and compassion.

Take a moment to thank yourself for taking this time to care for your well-being. Know that you can always return to this meditation whenever you need to find peace and solace within yourself.

I hope this guided meditation has brought you some comfort and peace. Take care.
