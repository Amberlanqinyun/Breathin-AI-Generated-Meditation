Let's start by finding a comfortable seated position, with your back straight and your hands resting gently on your knees. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your chest and stomach expand. Now exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing any tension you may be holding onto.

Take a moment to notice how you are feeling right now. Allow yourself to acknowledge any stress or sadness that you may be experiencing. Remember that it is okay to feel this way, and that you are not alone in these emotions.

Now, bring your awareness to your breath. As you continue to breathe deeply and slowly, imagine a warm, golden light surrounding you. This light represents love, compassion, and healing energy.

With each inhale, visualize this golden light entering your body, filling you with warmth and comfort. Feel this light soothing any areas of tension or pain within you. And with each exhale, imagine releasing any negative emotions or thoughts that no longer serve you.

As you continue to breathe in this way, repeat the following affirmations silently to yourself:

"I am worthy of love and compassion."
"I release all that no longer serves me."
"I am strong and capable of overcoming challenges."

Allow these affirmations to sink deep into your subconscious mind, planting seeds of positivity and self-love.

Now, bring your attention back to your breath. Take a moment to express gratitude for yourself and for taking this time to care for your well-being.

When you are ready, gently open your eyes and take a moment to stretch your body. Carry this sense of peace and inner strength with you as you go about your day.

Remember, it's okay to feel stressed and sad at times, but also know that you have the power within you to find peace and healing. Thank you for joining me in this meditation.
