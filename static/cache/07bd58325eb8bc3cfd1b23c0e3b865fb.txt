Welcome to this guided meditation for when you're feeling stressed at work. Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down, and let's begin.

Start by taking a few deep breaths in through your nose, and out through your mouth. With each breath, feel your body relax a little more.

Now, bring your awareness to any areas of tension in your body. Notice where you are holding stress - maybe in your shoulders, neck, or jaw. Take a moment to breathe into those areas and let the tension release with each exhale.

As you continue to breathe deeply, imagine a warm, golden light surrounding you. This light is filled with peace and calmness. Feel it gently wrapping around you, protecting you from any stress or negativity.

Now, bring your attention to your thoughts. Notice any racing or anxious thoughts that may be swirling around in your mind. Acknowledge them without judgment, and then imagine them floating away like clouds in the sky.

Focus on the present moment. Feel the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Notice the rise and fall of your chest with each inhale and exhale. Stay present in this moment, letting go of any worries about the past or future.

Take a moment to reflect on what you are grateful for in your work. Think about the positive aspects of your job and the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. Allow these thoughts to fill you with a sense of gratitude and appreciation.

Now, slowly begin to bring your awareness back to the room. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and gently open your eyes.

Remember that you have the power to stay calm and centered, no matter what challenges you may face at work. Carry this sense of peace with you as you continue with your day.

Thank you for joining me in this meditation. Take a moment to appreciate yourself for taking this time to care for your well-being. Have a wonderful day.
