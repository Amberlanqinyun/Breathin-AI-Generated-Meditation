Begin by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down, and close your eyes. Take a deep breath in, and slowly exhale, releasing any tension you may be holding onto.

As you continue to breathe deeply, bring your awareness to the sensations in your body. Notice where you might be feeling sadness or heaviness. Allow yourself to fully acknowledge these emotions without judgment.

Now, imagine a warm, comforting light surrounding you, wrapping you in a blanket of love and compassion. Feel this light filling you up, bringing a sense of peace and comfort to your being.

With each breath, imagine releasing the sadness and heaviness you are carrying within you. Visualize it leaving your body as you exhale, making space for lightness and joy to enter.

As you continue to breathe in this way, repeat the following affirmations silently or out loud:

"I acknowledge my sadness, and I allow myself to feel it fully."
"I am deserving of love and compassion, especially in times of struggle."
"I release the weight of my sadness and embrace lightness and peace within me."

Allow these affirmations to resonate within you, bringing a sense of comfort and healing to your heart. Remember that it is okay to feel sad, and that it is a natural part of the human experience.

Take a few more deep breaths, and when you are ready, slowly open your eyes. Carry this sense of peace and self-compassion with you as you continue with your day. You are not alone in your sadness, and you are worthy of love and healing.
