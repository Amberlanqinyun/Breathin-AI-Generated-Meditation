Welcome to this guided meditation for when you're feeling stressed due to work. Find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in through your nose, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Let's begin.

As you settle into this moment, bring your awareness to your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort. With each breath, allow yourself to release any physical tension you may be holding onto. Let go of any tightness in your shoulders, your back, and your jaw.

Now, shift your focus to your thoughts. Acknowledge any worries or stress related to work that may be present in your mind. Instead of pushing these thoughts away, simply observe them without judgment. Visualize them as passing clouds in the sky, coming and going.

Take a moment to connect with your breath. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest with each inhale and exhale. Allow your breath to anchor you in the present moment, letting go of any concerns about the past or future.

Now, bring to mind a place or situation where you feel completely at peace and relaxed. It could be a beach, a forest, or simply a cozy spot in your home. Imagine yourself there, surrounded by a sense of calm and tranquility.

As you visualize this peaceful place, allow yourself to fully immerse in the sensations and feelings of relaxation. Feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, the gentle breeze on your face, or the softness of the ground beneath you.

Stay in this peaceful place for a few moments, letting go of any stress or tension that may be weighing you down. Feel a sense of lightness and ease spreading throughout your body and mind.

When you are ready, gently bring your awareness back to the present moment. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly open your eyes.

Remember that you can always return to this inner sanctuary whenever you need a moment of calm and relaxation. Carry this sense of peace with you as you go about your day.

Thank you for taking the time to practice this guided meditation. May you find peace and serenity amidst the busyness of your workday.
