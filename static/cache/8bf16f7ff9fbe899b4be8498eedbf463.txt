Of course, let's take a few moments to center ourselves and find some peace. Find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your lungs expand. Hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing any tension or stress you may be feeling.

Let's take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow your body to relax even more. Feel your shoulders drop and your muscles loosen as you let go of any negativity or upset feelings.

Now, bring your awareness to your heart center. Visualize a warm, golden light glowing in the center of your chest. This light represents love, compassion, and healing energy. With each breath you take, feel this light expanding and radiating throughout your entire being.

As you continue to breathe deeply, repeat the following affirmations silently or out loud:

"I release all that no longer serves me.
I am worthy of love and peace.
I choose to let go of upset and embrace calm."

Feel the weight of your emotions lifting as you repeat these affirmations. Allow yourself to surrender to the present moment, letting go of any attachments to negative feelings or thoughts.

Take a few more deep breaths, feeling a sense of calm and serenity washing over you. Remember that it's okay to feel upset, but it's also important to give yourself the space to heal and find peace within.

When you're ready, slowly open your eyes and return to the present moment. Take a moment to check in with yourself and notice how you feel after this meditation. Remember that you have the power to choose how you respond to your emotions and that you are capable of finding peace within yourself.

Thank you for joining me in this meditation. I hope you feel more centered and at ease.
