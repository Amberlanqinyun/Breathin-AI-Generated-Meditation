Begin by finding a comfortable and quiet space where you can sit or lie down. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, allowing yourself to relax and let go of any tension in your body.

As you continue to breathe deeply, bring your awareness to the thoughts and feelings that are making you feel like you are a piece of shit. Without judgment, simply observe these thoughts and feelings with curiosity and compassion.

Now, imagine that you are surrounded by a warm, golden light. This light is filled with love, acceptance, and forgiveness. Allow this light to envelop you, wrapping you in a blanket of warmth and comfort.

With each breath, feel the light penetrating deep into your being, soothing any self-critical thoughts and feelings. Allow yourself to be fully present in this moment, letting go of any need to judge or criticize yourself.

Repeat the following affirmations silently or out loud:

"I am worthy of love and compassion."
"I am enough just as I am."
"I release any self-critical thoughts and feelings."

Continue to breathe deeply and feel the warmth of the golden light surrounding you. Allow yourself to bask in this feeling of love and acceptance for a few moments.

When you are ready, slowly bring your awareness back to the present moment. Take a few more deep breaths and gently open your eyes.

Remember that you are not defined by your thoughts or feelings. You are a unique and valuable individual deserving of love and compassion. Carry this feeling of self-acceptance with you throughout your day.
