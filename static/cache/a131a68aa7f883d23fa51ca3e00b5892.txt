Hello, thank you for joining me for this guided meditation. Let's take a few moments to help you release some of that stress you are feeling.

Find a comfortable seated position, with your back straight and your feet planted firmly on the ground. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your lungs expand with air. Now exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing any tension you may be holding in your body.

Let's bring our awareness to our breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils as you inhale, and the feeling of it leaving your body as you exhale. Take a few more deep breaths, allowing yourself to fully relax with each breath.

As you continue to breathe deeply, begin to scan your body for any areas of tension or discomfort. With each exhale, imagine releasing that tension and letting go of any stress you may be holding onto. Allow yourself to sink deeper into relaxation with each breath.

Now, I invite you to bring to mind a peaceful place or a happy memory. Visualize yourself in this place, feeling completely at ease and free from stress. Allow yourself to fully immerse in this moment of tranquility and calm.

Take a few more deep breaths, soaking in the peace and serenity of this imagined space. Know that you can return to this place whenever you need a moment of respite from the stresses of daily life.

When you are ready, gently open your eyes and return to the present moment. Take a moment to notice how you feel now compared to when we started this meditation. Remember that you can always come back to your breath and this sense of peace whenever you need it.

Thank you for meditating with me today. Have a wonderful day.
