Find a comfortable seated position, with your back straight and your hands resting gently on your knees. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your belly rise with the breath. Exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing any tension or stress.

Now, bring your awareness to your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort, and with each breath, allow those areas to soften and relax. Feel the support of the ground beneath you, grounding you and creating a sense of stability.

As you continue to breathe deeply and rhythmically, bring to mind a happy memory or a moment that brought you joy. Visualize yourself in that moment, fully experiencing the happiness and positivity that it brought you. Allow yourself to bask in that feeling of joy and contentment.

Now, shift your focus to the present moment. Notice the sounds around you, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the gentle rise and fall of your breath. Bring your attention to the present moment, letting go of any worries or concerns about the past or future.

Take a moment to express gratitude for the good things in your life. Think about the people, experiences, and things that bring you happiness and fulfillment. Feel a sense of gratitude and appreciation for all that you have.

As we come to the end of this meditation, take a few more deep breaths, feeling a sense of peace and contentment wash over you. Know that you have the power to cultivate happiness within yourself at any moment.

When you are ready, slowly open your eyes and take this feeling of happiness and contentment with you as you go about your day. Remember that happiness is a choice, and you have the power to choose it in every moment.
