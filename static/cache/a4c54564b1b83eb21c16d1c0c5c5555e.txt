Let's begin by finding a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your lungs expand, and exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing any tension you may be holding onto.

As you continue to breathe deeply, bring your awareness to the feelings of stress and overwhelm that you are experiencing due to work. Notice where in your body you are holding onto this tension. Take a moment to acknowledge these feelings without judgment.

Now, imagine a warm, soothing light surrounding you, enveloping you in a sense of calm and peace. With each breath you take, allow this light to penetrate every cell of your body, melting away any stress or tension you may be feeling.

As you continue to breathe in this calming light, visualize yourself at your place of work. See yourself moving through your tasks with ease and grace, feeling confident and capable in everything you do. Allow this visualization to bring a sense of empowerment and confidence into your being.

Now, bring your focus back to your breath. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, release any remaining stress or worries that may be weighing you down. Feel yourself becoming lighter and more at ease with each breath you take.

Take a few more deep breaths, allowing yourself to fully relax and let go of any remaining tension. Know that you have the strength and resilience to overcome any challenges that come your way.

When you are ready, slowly begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and gently open your eyes.

Remember that you have the power to navigate through any stressful situation with calmness and clarity. Carry this sense of peace with you as you go about your day. Thank you for taking this time to care for yourself.
