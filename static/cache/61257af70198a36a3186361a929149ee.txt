Let's find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down for this meditation. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in, filling your lungs completely, and then exhale slowly, releasing any tension you may be holding onto.

As you continue to breathe deeply and slowly, bring your awareness to the sensations in your body. Notice any areas of tightness or discomfort, and with each exhale, allow those areas to soften and relax.

Now, visualize yourself at work, surrounded by your tasks and responsibilities. Feel the weight of stress and pressure that you may be carrying in your body and mind. Acknowledge these feelings without judgment, knowing that it's okay to feel this way.

Take a moment to reflect on the reasons why you are feeling stressed about work. Are there specific challenges or situations that are causing you anxiety? Allow yourself to acknowledge these feelings and thoughts without becoming overwhelmed by them.

Now, imagine a warm and gentle light surrounding you, enveloping you in a sense of calm and peace. Feel this light soothing your mind and body, offering you comfort and reassurance.

With each breath, feel the light expanding within you, pushing out any lingering stress or tension. Allow yourself to release any negative thoughts or emotions, letting them drift away like leaves in a gentle breeze.

As you continue to breathe deeply, repeat the following affirmations silently to yourself:

"I release my stress and worries about work."
"I am capable and strong, and I can handle any challenges that come my way."
"I deserve to feel calm and at peace, both at work and in my life."

Feel these affirmations resonating within you, filling you with a sense of empowerment and confidence. Know that you are capable of facing any challenges that come your way.

Take a few more deep breaths, allowing yourself to bask in this feeling of calm and tranquility. When you are ready, gently open your eyes and return to the present moment, carrying this sense of peace with you as you continue on with your day.

Remember, it's okay to feel stressed at times, but it's important to take moments like this to center yourself and find inner peace. You are strong, capable, and deserving of a sense of calm in your life.
