Let's begin by finding a comfortable seated position, with your back straight and your hands resting gently on your lap. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your lungs expand with air, and then exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing any tension you may be holding onto.

As you continue to breathe deeply, I want you to bring your awareness to the feeling of stress that you are experiencing. Notice where in your body you are feeling this stress the most. Is it in your shoulders, your chest, your stomach? Take a moment to acknowledge these sensations without judgment.

Now, I invite you to imagine a soothing light surrounding you, enveloping you in a warm and comforting embrace. This light is filled with love, peace, and relaxation. As you breathe in, visualize this light entering your body, filling you with a sense of calm and tranquility.

With each breath, allow this light to dissolve the stress and tension you are feeling, replacing it with a sense of inner peace and serenity. Feel the weight of the stress lifting off of your shoulders, melting away into the light that surrounds you.

Continue to breathe deeply, allowing yourself to fully surrender to this moment of relaxation. Let go of any worries or thoughts that may be clouding your mind, and simply focus on the present moment.

As we come to the end of this meditation, take a few more deep breaths, feeling grounded and centered in your body. Know that you can return to this place of peace and calm whenever you need to throughout your day.

When you are ready, gently open your eyes and take a moment to notice how you are feeling now. Carry this sense of relaxation and tranquility with you as you continue with your day. Thank you for taking this time for yourself.
