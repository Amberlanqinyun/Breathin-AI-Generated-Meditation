Find a comfortable seated position, with your back straight and your hands resting gently on your knees. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in, filling your lungs completely, and exhale slowly, releasing any tension or negativity you may be feeling.

Focus on your breath, allowing it to flow naturally in and out of your body. With each inhale, imagine you are breathing in peace and calmness, and with each exhale, imagine you are letting go of any sadness or heaviness in your heart.

As you continue to breathe deeply, bring your awareness to your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort, and with each breath, imagine those areas softening and relaxing.

Now, visualize a warm, golden light surrounding you, enveloping you in a cocoon of love and healing energy. Feel this light penetrating every cell of your being, soothing your mind and uplifting your spirit.

Allow yourself to release any self-judgment or negative thoughts that may be weighing you down. Remember that it's okay to feel this way, and that you are deserving of love and compassion.

Take a moment to reflect on something you are grateful for in your life, no matter how small. Focus on this feeling of gratitude and let it fill your heart with warmth and positivity.

As we come to the end of this meditation, take a few more deep breaths, feeling a sense of peace and lightness within you. When you are ready, gently open your eyes and carry this feeling of calm and gratitude with you throughout the rest of your day.

Remember, it's okay to feel down sometimes, but know that you have the strength and resilience to overcome any challenges that come your way. You are deserving of love, peace, and happiness. Thank you for joining me in this meditation.
